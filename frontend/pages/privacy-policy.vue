      We partner with third-party advertising companies who also use these tracking tools to provide advertisements on other websites. These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Site. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Site. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. While we do not knowingly provide these entities with information that personally identifies you such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.

You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance.

      Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings.

It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.

      Collection, Use, and Disclosure of End Users’ Information Through Our Services

We provide our clients with the ability to create profiles of their End Users in order to effectively communicate with them via marketing communications tools like email, analytics services. To do this, our clients integrate our technology into their applications, websites, or other online services.

      Our clients’ collection, use, and disclosure of data is separately governed by their privacy policies. Our clients may collect information about their users directly; in that case, each of our clients is responsible for ensuring that their data collection follows their privacy policies and terms of use.
